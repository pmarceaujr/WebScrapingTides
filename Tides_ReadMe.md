Write a simple Python web scraper to help us visit the tide pools.

Go to https://www.tide-forecast.com/ to get tide forecasts for these locations:

Half Moon Bay, California
Huntington Beach, California
Providence, Rhode Island
Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina

Load the tide forecast page for each location and extract information on low tides that occur after sunrise and before sunset. Return the time and height for each daylight low tide.
In your response, be sure to include a URL where we can see the code and a description of how to run it (including installing dependencies, if needed).
